## Bug #001: Service Restart Loop (Port Conflict)

### Symptoms
- `systemctl status benchai` shows constant restarts (470+ restart count)
- Service status shows `activating (auto-restart)`
- Journal logs show: `ERROR: [Errno 98] error while attempting to bind on address ('0.0.0.0', 8085): address already in use`
- Health check (`curl localhost:8085/health`) returns OK intermittently

### Root Cause
When the BenchAI service restarts (either manually or due to a crash), an orphan Python process from the previous instance may still be holding port 8085. The new instance fails to bind, systemd marks it as failed, and triggers another restart - creating an infinite loop.

The router code has internal cleanup (`[CLEANUP] Found 1 orphaned llama-server processes, killing...`), but this runs AFTER the port binding fails, making it ineffective.

### Impact
- Service appears unstable
- High CPU usage from constant restarts
- Restart counter grows indefinitely
- May confuse monitoring systems

### Fix Applied
Updated `services/benchai.service` to add pre-start and post-stop cleanup:

```ini
# Kill any orphan processes before starting
ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'pkill -9 -f "llm_router.py" 2>/dev/null || true'
ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'sleep 1'

# Cleanup after stop
ExecStopPost=/bin/bash -c 'pkill -9 -f "llm_router.py" 2>/dev/null || true'
ExecStopPost=/bin/bash -c 'pkill -9 -f "llama-server" 2>/dev/null || true'
```

### How to Apply Fix
```bash
# Update service file
sudo cp services/benchai.service /etc/systemd/system/benchai.service

# Reload and restart
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart benchai

# Verify
systemctl status benchai
curl http://localhost:8085/health
```

### Prevention
The fix ensures:
1. Before start: Any orphan router processes are killed
2. Brief pause to release port
3. After stop: Cleanup of router and llama-server processes

## System Scan Results

### Components Checked
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Router Code | ✅ OK | 6,257 lines, no syntax errors |
| Service File | ✅ FIXED | Added cleanup hooks |
| Memory DB | ✅ OK | WAL mode, FTS5 enabled |
| RAG DB | ✅ OK | 346 documents indexed |
| Docker | ✅ OK | All containers healthy |
| Dependencies | ✅ OK | All Python packages installed |

### Current Health
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "benchai-router-v3",
  "features": {
    "streaming": true,
    "memory": true,
    "tts": true,
    "rag": true,
    "obsidian": true
  }
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **Apply the service file fix** to prevent future restart loops
2. **Monitor restart count** with: `systemctl show benchai -p NRestarts`
3. **Set up log rotation** for `/var/log/benchai-router.log`
4. **Consider adding health check** in systemd for better monitoring
